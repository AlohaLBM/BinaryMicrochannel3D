Following is a list of papers that might be helpful for you. Includes both CFD modeling papers and film thickness. 
Some of them are for square geometry. You can follow up the references from these papers and find data for rectangular channels.

Hope this will be helpful. Please let me know if I can be of any help.

 

Best Regards

For CFD you can start with Akbar(1) and Kreutzer(7) papers.

Based on my quick literature review  on film thickness I haven’t seen many papers on film thickness in rectangular microchannels. But you can rely on ref. 2,4,5,6. 
There is no single author who is considered an expert in these experiments. I suggest you look all at the experimental data for square/rectangular channels and try to see which fits your simulation parameters.

 

Good luck

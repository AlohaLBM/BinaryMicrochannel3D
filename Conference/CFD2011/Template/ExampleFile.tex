\section{Introduction}
The introduction goes here.


\newpage



\section{Model Description}
You should give a thorough description of your model.
\vspace{4cm}
\subsection{Example of Subheading}
Here is how to produce a numbered equation under a second level
heading \cite{James1988}.
\vspace{2cm}\\
\emph{Continuity equation}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \rho_G}{\partial t}+\nabla\left(\rho_G\mathbf
    u\right)=0
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Example of Sub-subheading}
This is how \cite{Luke1988} produced an unnumbered equation under a
third level heading.
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf J=\sigma(\mathbf E+\mathbf u\times\mathbf B)
\end{equation}

\section{Results}
The results of using the \LaTeX template is a great looking paper.
In Figures \ref{fig:label1} and \ref{fig:label2} it can be seen how figures are easily included.
In Table \ref{tab:label} it is seen how we can include a table.
The table is constructed in the file table.tex, where also the table caption and label are defined.

\InsTab{Table}


\section{Conclusion}
The conclusions are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Trondheim is a nice city.
  \item CFD is great fun, and useful too.
\end{enumerate}
